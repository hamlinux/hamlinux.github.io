<p>Unless its 2021.  I&#39;ve figured that once the low fuel warning light goes off on the mini van there is arguably still between 40 and 60 miles of reserve left.  Having fished with a client the digital MTE (Miles till Empty) display showed 5 miles remaining in the tank.  We had plenty of time and had earned an early Mexican dinner.  First we needed to get some fuel to carry us on our way.  At the Interstate on-ramp it was gridlock, but only turning into the Citgo at the Hilday Inn.  Everyone was trying to purchase gas with vehicles parked two of three lanes deep into the State Highway.  We pulled around to the left to pass the scene noticing the recently placed yellow &#8220;out of service&#8221; bags over many of the pumps.  We drove on to the Grocery&#47;Gas store and they are already out.  We are still good for a while though, so lets get a Burrito.</p>

<p>After Dinner the lines are longer and more pumps are closed.  Horns are honking and the situaion is noticably tense.  Let&#39;s hopsctch exits back towards home where there is less population so maybe a better chance to find a few gallons before it gets dark.  Back home the situation is the same. No fuel and none on the horizon.</p>

<p>A search of the local news states that Russian hackers have attacked the Colonial Pipeline and the Govenor has declared a state of emergency.  In otherwards &#8220;Hey ya&#39;ll panic!&#8220; and buy as much gas as you can before you can&#39;t drive to the Post Officed to pick up your unemployment check.  Funny how quiet things can be when the local meth heads don&#39;t have cruising gas to do burnouts up and down the road in their mufflerless POS trucks at 3 am.  The next day dawned with quite the quiet morning which was nice because I just made it home before the fumes ran out so currently have no where to go.</p>

<p>By three o&#39;clock the stations were starting to get refills and running out just as fast.  I go my $20 maximum of Premium in a 5 gallon gas can and headed back to the house after stopping off for a beer, because we have plenty to go around.</p>

<p>As far a I can tell the ransomware attack did not directly affect the pipelines ability to deliver any fuel, but the fear of shortage turned most of my neighbors into fuel hungry petrochemical vampires and now there are people stranded on the Highway and pugillism reigns at the Murphy Express.  It&#39;s a good thing that former Vice President Joe Biden has earmarked billions of dollars for CISA to protect the government&#39;s Cyber infrastructure, and if the Gas and Oil Indusrty can&#39;t get it&#39;s act together I am sure CISA will be more than happy to offer their help. And the sheep will bleat approvingly.</p>
