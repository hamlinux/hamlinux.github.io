<p>I&#39;ve been wanting to try out the BSD&#39;s for quite some time. I was really motivated to give it a go with all of the drama in the Linux world over SystemD, RMS, and Linus being told to take a vacation from the Linux Kernel over his &#8220;Unsatisfactory&#8221; behaviorin the Commune-IT. Looking into FreeBSD arguably the most widely adopted flavor, I quickly was bombarded with news of the new COC and the moratorium on Cyber Hugs. All I wanted was a platform to compile unadulterated source from the guys at Suckless where I could get work done without being overwhelmed by the ravings of phantom Free Sofware SJW&#39;s from around the globe.</p>

<p>Thanks to FreeBSD and the COC I landed on the OpenBSD website and the sense of peaceful possibility began to emanate with the first welcome email from the Benevolent Dictator himself! RTFM made sense because the manual made sense. No extra goo to wade through. Just clean code that felt good to work with. My environment for several years had been Dwm, St, Dmenu and other Suckless standards, so I quickly imported from my trusty dotfile repo and was off to the races.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. I still have a Debian box or two for when I need to use OBS or spin up some Kali image just to burn it back down. The machine that goes with me everywhere though is my Toughbook CF-19 and I have my 6.9 development environment for this site on my Big Rig at home squarely mounted atop KVM. The Magnesium body of my toughbook is a bit hotter to the touch and the battery might not last as long, but everything I need just works. As the craziness that is Modern America devolves into a Xombie apocalypse, at least I know OpenBSD is on my hip.</p>
